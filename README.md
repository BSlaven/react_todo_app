# My main todo list app

## [Live Demo](https://stodo-list-app.netlify.app/)

## State Management

- Luckily this app is not complicated enough that the obvious prop drilling
becomes a problem.

- Although prop drilling should be avoided anyway I opted to keep it
due to app's simplicity.

- In other circumstances some king od state management library
like Redux.

## Styling completed items
- Some additional styling may be applied on the completed item
besides the simple line-through.
